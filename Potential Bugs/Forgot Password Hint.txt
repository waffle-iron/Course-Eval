Description:
I didn't have an account, and wanted to see what would happen if I typed in my email in forgot password. Spoiler Alert- No email was sent.

From 
http://evaluations.greenrivertech.net/InstructorEvaluation/Login
Clicked on Forgot Password. 
Saw visual hint of text box followed by @greenriver.edu and Close button on the bottom.
Assumed I just need to type in the prefix of my email.
Typed in: jschwarzwalder and nothing happened


Expected: a submit button to show, and for it to send an email to jschwarzwalder @greenriver.edu 

Action:
When I pressed enter: got a strange warning that said "Please include an @ in the email address. 'jschwarzwalder' is missing an '@'.
